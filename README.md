A **deterministic, tool-using AI Agent** built from scratch in Python. Unlike standard chatbots, this agent follows a strict **"Think → Execute → Wait"** protocol to perform multi-step tasks, manipulate local files, and validate mathematical operations without hallucinating.

## ⚡ Why This Agent?

Most AI scripts fail because they try to do too much at once. This agent is engineered for **reliability**:

- **🛡️ Sequential Execution:** Enforces a strict _Stop & Wait_ rule. The agent cannot write a report until it has actually received data from a tool
- **🧮 Smart Calculator:** Capable of processing entire files of data (e.g., "Find the average of `scores.txt`") rather than just simple arithmetic
- **✅ Input Sanitization:** Includes a dedicated `validator.py` module that strips garbage text from inputs and prevents crashes (like Division by Zero)
- **🔁 Loop Protection:** Automatically detects if the agent is getting stubborn (retrying failed actions) and forces a stop
